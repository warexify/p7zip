<H1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</H1>

<H4>Why command line version does not add files that do not have any extension?</H4>

<P>You probably use *.* wildcard. 
7-Zip doesn't uses system wildcard mask parser, and 7-Zip doesn't follow  
that archaic rule, when *.* means any file. 
7-Zip treats *.* as any file that have extension. 
To process all files you must use * wildcard or omit wildcard at all.</P>


<H4>Why adding, deleting and updating of existing archive doesn't work?</H4>

<P>Current version of 7-Zip cannot change archive, created with solid option
switched on.</P>

<H4>What about ACE archive supporting?</H4>

<P>Supporting ACE can be implemented, if source code 
of that format will be available, and if license of source code 
will allow using that code.</P>
